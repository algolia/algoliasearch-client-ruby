      # Whether to support phrase matching and excluding words from search queries Use the `advancedSyntaxFeatures` parameter to control which feature is supported.
      attr_accessor :advanced_syntax

      # Advanced search syntax features you want to support - `exactPhrase`.   Phrases in quotes must match exactly.   For example, `sparkly blue \"iPhone case\"` only returns records with the exact string \"iPhone case\" - `excludeWords`.   Query words prefixed with a `-` must not occur in a record.   For example, `search -engine` matches records that contain \"search\" but not \"engine\" This setting only has an effect if `advancedSyntax` is true.
      attr_accessor :advanced_syntax_features

      # Whether to allow typos on numbers in the search query Turn off this setting to reduce the number of irrelevant matches when searching in large sets of similar numbers.
      attr_accessor :allow_typos_on_numeric_tokens

      # Determine which plurals and synonyms should be considered an exact matches By default, Algolia treats singular and plural forms of a word, and single-word synonyms, as [exact](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/#exact) matches when searching. For example - \"swimsuit\" and \"swimsuits\" are treated the same - \"swimsuit\" and \"swimwear\" are treated the same (if they are [synonyms](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/#regular-synonyms)) - `ignorePlurals`.   Plurals and similar declensions added by the `ignorePlurals` setting are considered exact matches - `singleWordSynonym`.   Single-word synonyms, such as \"NY\" = \"NYC\", are considered exact matches - `multiWordsSynonym`.   Multi-word synonyms, such as \"NY\" = \"New York\", are considered exact matches.
      attr_accessor :alternatives_as_exact

      # Whether this search will be included in Analytics.
      attr_accessor :analytics

      # Whether the best matching attribute should be determined by minimum proximity This setting only affects ranking if the Attribute ranking criterion comes before Proximity in the `ranking` setting. If true, the best matching attribute is selected based on the minimum proximity of multiple matches. Otherwise, the best matching attribute is determined by the order in the `searchableAttributes` setting.
      attr_accessor :attribute_criteria_computed_by_min_proximity

      # Attributes to highlight By default, all searchable attributes are highlighted. Use `*` to highlight all attributes or use an empty array `[]` to turn off highlighting. Attribute names are case-sensitive With highlighting, strings that match the search query are surrounded by HTML tags defined by `highlightPreTag` and `highlightPostTag`. You can use this to visually highlight matching parts of a search query in your UI For more information, see [Highlighting and snippeting](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/highlighting-snippeting/js).
      attr_accessor :attributes_to_highlight

      # Attributes to include in the API response To reduce the size of your response, you can retrieve only some of the attributes. Attribute names are case-sensitive - `*` retrieves all attributes, except attributes included in the `customRanking` and `unretrievableAttributes` settings. - To retrieve all attributes except a specific one, prefix the attribute with a dash and combine it with the `*`: `[\"*\", \"-ATTRIBUTE\"]`. - The `objectID` attribute is always included.
      attr_accessor :attributes_to_retrieve

      # Attributes for which to enable snippets. Attribute names are case-sensitive Snippets provide additional context to matched words. If you enable snippets, they include 10 words, including the matched word. The matched word will also be wrapped by HTML tags for highlighting. You can adjust the number of words with the following notation: `ATTRIBUTE:NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the number of words to be extracted.
      attr_accessor :attributes_to_snippet

      # Whether to include a `queryID` attribute in the response The query ID is a unique identifier for a search query and is required for tracking [click and conversion events](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/getting-started).
      attr_accessor :click_analytics

      # Whether to split compound words in the query into their building blocks For more information, see [Word segmentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/language-specific-configurations/#splitting-compound-words). Word segmentation is supported for these languages: German, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian. Decompounding doesn't work for words with [non-spacing mark Unicode characters](https://www.charactercodes.net/category/non-spacing_mark). For example, `Gartenstühle` won't be decompounded if the `ü` consists of `u` (U+0075) and `◌̈` (U+0308).
      attr_accessor :decompound_query

      # Searchable attributes for which you want to [turn off the Exact ranking criterion](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/override-search-engine-defaults/in-depth/adjust-exact-settings/#turn-off-exact-for-some-attributes). Attribute names are case-sensitive This can be useful for attributes with long values, where the likelihood of an exact match is high, such as product descriptions. Turning off the Exact ranking criterion for these attributes favors exact matching on other attributes. This reduces the impact of individual attributes with a lot of content on ranking.
      attr_accessor :disable_exact_on_attributes

      # Attributes for which you want to turn off [typo tolerance](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/typo-tolerance).

This can happen with attributes that are long blocks of text, such as product descriptions Consider alternatives such as `disableTypoToleranceOnWords` or adding synonyms if your attributes have intentional unusual spellings that might look like typos.

You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:  - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`. - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters.   **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)` - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`  Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes. If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.
