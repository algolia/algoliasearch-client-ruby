      # Keywords to be used instead of the search query to conduct a more broader search.  Using the `similarQuery` parameter changes other settings:  - `queryType` is set to `prefixNone`. - `removeStopWords` is set to true. - `words` is set as the first ranking criterion. - All remaining words are treated as `optionalWords`.  Since the `similarQuery` is supposed to do a broad search, they usually return many results. Combine it with `filters` to narrow down the list of results.
      attr_accessor :similar_query

      # Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response.  You can use these filter expressions:  - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`. - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>` where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of the range (inclusive). - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>` where `<facet>` is a facet attribute (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value. - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>` (case-sensitive). - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`.  You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:  - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`. - You can't use `NOT` with combinations of filters.   **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)` - You can't combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`  Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes. If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.

      # Determines the order in which Algolia returns your results.  By default, each entry corresponds to a [ranking criteria](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/). The tie-breaking algorithm sequentially applies each criterion in the order they're specified. If you configure a replica index for [sorting by an attribute](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/sorting/how-to/sort-by-attribute/), you put the sorting attribute at the top of the list.  **Modifiers**  - `asc(\"ATTRIBUTE\")`.   Sort the index by the values of an attribute, in ascending order. - `desc(\"ATTRIBUTE\")`.   Sort the index by the values of an attribute, in descending order.  Before you modify the default setting, you should test your changes in the dashboard, and by [A/B testing](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/ab-testing/what-is-ab-testing/).

      # Attributes to highlight.  By default, all searchable attributes are highlighted. Use `*` to highlight all attributes or use an empty array `[]` to turn off highlighting. Attribute names are case-sensitive.  With highlighting, strings that match the search query are surrounded by HTML tags defined by `highlightPreTag` and `highlightPostTag`. You can use this to visually highlight matching parts of a search query in your UI.

Returning only exact matches can help when:  - [Searching in hyphenated attributes](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/typo-tolerance/how-to/how-to-search-in-hyphenated-attributes/). - Reducing the number of matches when you have too many.   This can happen with attributes that are long blocks of text, such as product descriptions.  Consider alternatives such as `disableTypoToleranceOnWords` or adding synonyms if your attributes have intentional unusual spellings that might look like typos.

      attr_accessor :ignore_plurals

      attr_accessor :remove_stop_words

      # Languages for language-specific query processing steps such as plurals, stop-word removal, and word-detection dictionaries.  This setting sets a default list of languages used by the `removeStopWords` and `ignorePlurals` settings. This setting also sets a dictionary for word detection in the logogram-based [CJK](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/normalization/#normalization-for-logogram-based-languages-cjk) languages. To support this, you must place the CJK language **first**.  **You should always specify a query language.** If you don't specify an indexing language, the search engine uses all [supported languages](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/supported-languages/), or the languages you specified with the `ignorePlurals` or `removeStopWords` parameters. This can lead to unexpected search results. For more information, see [Language-specific configuration](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/language-specific-configurations/).
      attr_accessor :query_languages

For more information, see [Word segmentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/in-depth/language-specific-configurations/#splitting-compound-words). Word segmentation is supported for these languages: German, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian. Decompounding doesn't work for words with [non-spacing mark Unicode characters](https://www.charactercodes.net/category/non-spacing_mark). For example, `Gartenstühle` won't be decompounded if the `ü` consists of `u` (U+0075) and `◌̈` (U+0308).

Attribute names are case-sensitive.  This can be useful for attributes with long values, where the likelihood of an exact match is high, such as product descriptions. Turning off the Exact ranking criterion for these attributes favors exact matching on other attributes. This reduces the impact of individual attributes with a lot of content on ranking.
      attr_accessor :disable_exact_on_attributes

      attr_accessor :exact_on_single_word_query

      # Determine which plurals and synonyms should be considered an exact matches.  By default, Algolia treats singular and plural forms of a word, and single-word synonyms, as [exact](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/#exact) matches when searching. For example:  - \"swimsuit\" and \"swimsuits\" are treated the same - \"swimsuit\" and \"swimwear\" are treated the same (if they are [synonyms](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/adding-synonyms/#regular-synonyms)).  - `ignorePlurals`.   Plurals and similar declensions added by the `ignorePlurals` setting are considered exact matches.  - `singleWordSynonym`.   Single-word synonyms, such as \"NY\" = \"NYC\", are considered exact matches.  - `multiWordsSynonym`.   Multi-word synonyms, such as \"NY\" = \"New York\", are considered exact matches.
      attr_accessor :alternatives_as_exact

      # Advanced search syntax features you want to support.  - `exactPhrase`.   Phrases in quotes must match exactly.   For example, `sparkly blue \"iPhone case\"` only returns records with the exact string \"iPhone case\".  - `excludeWords`.   Query words prefixed with a `-` must not occur in a record.   For example, `search -engine` matches records that contain \"search\" but not \"engine\".  This setting only has an effect if `advancedSyntax` is true.
      attr_accessor :advanced_syntax_features

      attr_accessor :distinct

      # Whether to replace a highlighted word with the matched synonym.  By default, the original words are highlighted even if a synonym matches. For example, with `home` as a synonym for `house` and a search for `home`, records matching either \"home\" or \"house\" are included in the search results, and either \"home\" or \"house\" are highlighted.  With `replaceSynonymsInHighlight` set to `true`, a search for `home` still matches the same records, but all occurrences of \"house\" are replaced by \"home\" in the highlighted response.
      attr_accessor :replace_synonyms_in_highlight

      # Minimum proximity score for two matching words.  This adjusts the [Proximity ranking criterion](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/relevance-overview/in-depth/ranking-criteria/#proximity) by equally scoring matches that are farther apart.

      # Properties to include in the API response of search and browse requests.  By default, all response properties are included. To reduce the response size, you can select which properties should be included.  An empty list may lead to an empty API response (except properties you can't exclude).  You can't exclude these properties: `message`, `warning`, `cursor`, `abTestVariantID`, or any property added by setting `getRankingInfo` to true.  Your search depends on the `hits` field. If you omit this field, searches won't return any results. Your UI might also depend on other properties, for example, for pagination. Before restricting the response size, check the impact on your search experience.
